# Single Cycle Cpu In Logisim

## Description
- A single-cycle implementation of a subset of the ARMv7 instruction set using digital logic in Logisim.
The .s files are the Armv7 assembly code for the functions described below in the instructions. The code was written and intended to be 
run on a raspberry pi. 

- In this project I designed digital circuits using schematic entry as well as a hardware description language (HDL). I used Logisim for designing and simulating digital circuits.

- The .circ file is the Logisim file that contains the digital circuits.

## Instructions:
In the main, the Rom Selector is what selects which program to run. 
- 00 = sum_array
- 01 = fib_iter
- 10 = fib_rec
- 11 = find_max

### Misc.
You can download Logisim from here: http://www.cburch.com/logisim/

Macs need Java 6 runtime https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US
